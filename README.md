# My name is Flavo!
I'm a passionate developer stuck in an eternal learning loop. Coding for me is not a job, but rather a fun and pleasent experience. Primarily a web dev, I ended up learning the secrets of the ancient full stack technique, but I keep myself in this journey to learn new technologies and programming languages.

## Languages, technologies and IDEs I already master

## You might be able to reach me through
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/flavo-barth/" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-%230077B5?style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" target="_blank"></a><br><br>
All other social media I have are purely personal and private. Unless you are a very close friend to me, you won't find me there ;)

## Fun fact?
You will never see me using a language framework (e.g., Symfony for PHP), as I see such implementations as an <i>unnecessary</i> evil. If we ever catch a coffee together, I may further explain my theories on this and many other subjects. Including philosophy, which is also something I love.
